In the year of the 700th Olympiad, a plague swept the planet. 

The Ancients measure the passing of years by the Olympiad, every four years, which they understood to have begun in what we call 776 BCE.

So death of Caesar in 44 BCE = 184th Olympiad, and so on, until the Olympics ended circa 393 AD, or during the 293rd Olympiad. 

The modern Olympics were revived in 1896, which according to the Ancient system, was the 669th Olympiad.

This year 2020 is the 700th Olympiad, and the games have been postponed for a year because of a plague.
